            <br />
            <p>
              Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural world, physical
              universe, material world or material universe. "Nature" refers to
              the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
              Manufactured objects and human interaction are, in common usage,
              not considered part of nature unless qualified in ways such as
              "human nature" or "the whole of nature". Nature is generally
              distinguished from the supernatural. It ranges in scale from the
              subatomic to the galactic.

            <h3>Earth</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Earth (or, "the earth")the fifth largest planet in the solar
              system, third in order of distance from the Sun. It is the largest
              of its planetary system's terrestrial planets and the only place
              in the universe known to support life.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The most prominent features of the earth's climate are its two
              large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a
              wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region. Precipitation
              patterns vary widely according to location, ranging from several
              metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. About 70
              percent of the surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The
              remainder consists of continents and islands, with the vast
              majority of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.
            </p>

            <h3>Life</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of
              life, scientists generally accept that the biological
              manifestation of life is characterized by organization,
              metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and
              reproduction. Life may also be said to be simply the
              characteristic state of organisms.
